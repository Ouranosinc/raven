Setup this example on new system
--------------------------------------


(1) The OSTRICH executable

    There are several executables available with this example. You can try if one of
    them runs on your system. If not, download the source from:
         http://www.eng.buffalo.edu/~lsmatott/Ostrich/OstrichMain.html
    Compile, for example, sequential version using GCC compiler by
    	 $ make GCC
    Compile, for example, MPI version using MPI C++ compiler by
    	 $ make MPI

    When you found or created a working executable, copy it to the example folder.

(2) The RAVEN executable

    There are several executables available with this example (see subfolder "model").
    You can try if one of them runs on your system. If not, download the source from:
         http://raven.uwaterloo.ca/Downloads.html
    Compile it by running
    	 $ make
    By default netCDF support is activated. You might need to change the path to the
    netCDF library in the Makefile. If you dont want to use netCDF or you don't have
    the library installed you should set the CXXFLAGS and LDLIBS in the Makefile by:
    	 CXXFLAGS +=
	 LDLIBS   :=
    When you found or created a running executable, copy it to the "model" subfolder
    and call it "Raven.exe". If you want to use another name for some reason, you have
    to change it in "Ost-RAVEN.sh/bat" as well.

(3) Scripts

    This example contains two scripts:
    	 Ost-RAVEN.sh (Linux/MacOS) and Ost-RAVEN.bat (Windows)
	 save_best.sh (Linux/MacOS) and save_best.bat (Windows)
    Those scripts are specifed in the OSTRICH setup file "ostIn.txt" (see first few lines).
    If you switch between Windows and a Unix system you have to change the file endings
    in the OSTRICH setup file. The example comes with two setup files- one for Windows and
    one for Unix.
