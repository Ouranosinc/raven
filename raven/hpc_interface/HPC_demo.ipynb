    "This notebook shows how to use the distributed [raven/ostrich module](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/raven/wiki/Technical-Notes) on Compute Canada infrastructure. It runs a complete example of transferring local input data files required by raven/ostrich, running the tool remotely and retrieving the results."

    "* Authentication: how to access Compute Canada (CC) infrastructure\n",
    "* Job submission: how to interact with CC's job scheduler\n",
    "* Data transfer: how to copy the local data remotely and retrieve the generated output files\n",

    "## Authentication\n",
    "The initial objective was to allow users to use their own credentials when running jobs on a CC cluster. This proved to be complicated because it would force users to upload their private keys to the server hosting the module (potential key compromission in the event of a security breach). A simpler approach has been adopted: create a _common_ user on CC side (called _crim01_) and execute jobs on its behalf."

   "source": [
    "## Job submission\n",
    "Compute Canada does not provide rest APIs to allow job submissions from remote applications. Such tools exist but their deployment is rather a long-term plan on CC's roadmap. The unique solution is to take advantage of ssh's ability to execute commands on a remote machine, where commands in this context are the slurm utilities for job management (_sbatch_ for submission, _sacct_ for status enquiry and _scancel_ for job suppression). For our concern, jobs have four states: \"PENDING\" (sitting in the job queue), \"RUNNING\" (execution), \"TIMEOUT\" (job took too long to execute) and \"CANCEL\" (job was killed by the user)."

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Data transfer\n",
    "Again, the lack of public API imposes the use of \"simple\" tools such as _tar_ and _scp_ for data transfer. The series of steps include tarring the local input data (sitting in a directory whose path is provided to the module by the user), copying the tar file to crim01's working directory, untarring, running the job, tarring the results, copying the results tar file back to the caller (the module) and untarring it inside the directory provided by the user."

    "## Executable setup\n",
    "The most elegant way to invoke either _raven_ or _ostrich_ on CC side is to launch a container that is configured to execute them. Predefined paths inside the container are mapped to subfolders in CRIM01's working directory and raven/ostrich are configured to make use of those predefined paths, for reading the parameter files and writing the output results. When thinking of containers, docker comes to mind but this technology is reportedly not appropriate for high-performance computing (https://dev.to/grokcode/singularity--a-docker-for-hpc-environments-i6p), so this is why Singularity has been chosen as container platform. Two Singularity images (one for _raven_, one for _ostrich_) are hosted in a public registry that has been set up at CRIM (132.217.141.54); when slurm schedules the job for execution (state RUNNING), the Singularity command-line tool pulls the appropriate image from the registry and executes it."
