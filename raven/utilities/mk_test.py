    The purpose of the Mann-Kendall (MK) test (Mann 1945, Kendall 1975, Gilbert
    1987) is to statistically assess if there is a monotonic upward or downward
    trend of the variable of interest over time. A monotonic upward (downward)
    trend means that the variable consistently increases (decreases) through
    time, but the trend may or may not be linear. The MK test can be used in
    place of a parametric linear regression analysis, which can be used to test
    if the slope of the estimated linear regression line is different from
    zero. The regression analysis requires that the residuals from the fitted
    regression line be normally distributed; an assumption not required by the
    MK test, that is, the MK test is a non-parametric (distribution-free) test.
    Hirsch, Slack and Smith (1982, page 107) indicate that the MK test is best
    viewed as an exploratory analysis and is most appropriately used to
    identify stations where changes are significant or of large magnitude and
    to quantify these findings.
    Input:
        x:   a vector of data
        alpha: significance level (0.05 default)
    Output:
        trend: tells the trend (increasing, decreasing or no trend)
        h: True (if trend is present) or False (if trend is absence)
        p: p value of the significance test
        z: normalized test statistics

    This function is an implementation of the "Calculation of Number of Samples
    Required to Detect a Trend" section written by Sat Kumar Tomer
    (satkumartomer@gmail.com) which can be found at:
    http://vsp.pnnl.gov/help/Vsample/Design_Trend_Mann_Kendall.htm
    As stated on the webpage in the URL above the method uses a Monte-Carlo
    simulation to determine the required number of points in time, n, to take a
    measurement in order to detect a linear trend for specified small
    probabilities that the MK test will make decision errors. If a non-linear
    trend is actually present, then the value of n computed by VSP is only an
    approximation to the correct n. If non-detects are expected in the
    resulting data, then the value of n computed by VSP is only an
    approximation to the correct n, and this approximation will tend to be less
    accurate as the number of non-detects increases.
    Input:
        beta: probability of falsely accepting the null hypothesis
        delta: change per sample period, i.e., the change that occurs between
               two adjacent sampling times
        std_dev: standard deviation of the sample points.
        alpha: significance level (0.05 default)
        n: initial number of sample points (4 default).
        num_iter: number of iterations of the Monte-Carlo simulation (1000
                  default).
        tol: tolerance level to decide if the predicted probability is close
             enough to the required statistical power value (1e-6 default).
        num_cycles: Total number of cycles of the simulation. This is to ensure
                    that the simulation does finish regardless of convergence
                    or not (10000 default).
        m: if the tolerance is too small then the simulation could continue to
           cycle through the same sample numbers over and over. This parameter
           determines how many cycles to look back. If the same number of
           samples was been determined m cycles ago then the simulation will
           stop.
