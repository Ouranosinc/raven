    "Welcome to this PAVICS-Hydro tutorial, where we will explore the various hydrological modelling and forecasting possibilities offered by PAVICS-Hydro. The platform uses the [Raven hydrological modelling framework](http://raven.uwaterloo.ca/) to emulate different hydrological models, and relies on various scientific Python libraries to analyze the results. This tutorial starts by exploring the JupyterLab environment that this notebook is currently running on.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Upload files here by using drag-and-drop OR using the button to that effect above the file explorer to send files from computer to the server (e.g. watershed boundaries, model files, input data, streamflow data, etc.) as required;\n",
    "- Cut, Copy, Paste files from one folder to another in the JupyterLab server;\n",
    "- Download files by right-clicking the file and saving to your computer locally;\n",

    "- Shutting down a running notebook by right-clicking and selecting \"Shut Down Kernel\".\n",

    "## The file editor\n",
    "\n",
    "The file editor is what is being used right now to read the contents of a notebook! It is what is on the right side of your screen. If you open multiple notebooks, there will be as many tabs open on the top of the file explorer. This is where the magic happens! Once a notebook has been opened, you can see that there are some \"Text\" cells and some \"Code\" cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **text cells** give context to what is happening and can be seen as meta-comments on top of the regular code comments, to ensure everything is clear to the users. The cell you are currently reading, for example, is a code cell. If you double-click it, you can modify its contents. To make it appear as text again, press the \"play\" or \"run\" button in the button list at the top of the file editor.\n",
