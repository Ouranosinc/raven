    "\n",
    "The general idea is to initialize the state of the hydrological model to represent current conditions, but instead of using weather forecasts to predict future flows, we run the model with observed, historical weather series from past years. So for example if we have 30 years of weather observations, we get 30 different forecasts. The accuracy of this forecast ensemble can then be evaluated by different probabilistic metrics."
