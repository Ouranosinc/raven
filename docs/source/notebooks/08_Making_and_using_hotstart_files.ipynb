For each of these, templated configuration files are available to facilitate launching the model with options passed by Python at run-time. In this block of code, we are going to run the GR4JCN model and provide a list of configuration parameters. Please see the documentation for more details on the mandatory vs optional parameters, and what they represent. A glimpse is provided here."
