These notebooks demonstrates a few features of the Raven server.

If you're unfamiliar with notebooks, note that typing `TAB` after an object will display a drop-down menu of the object's attributes and methods, and that you need to hit `CTRL-Enter` to run a *cell*. You can also type `?` after a function or method to display the corresponding help message.

Note that some of these notebooks need the bleeding edge version of OWSLib_ (>=0.17.1) and Birdy_ (> 0.6.1) since some issues were found and fixed in the process of writing these notebooks.
